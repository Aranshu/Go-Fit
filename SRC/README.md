# Go-Fit

## Introduction
* We have designed an application in the era of a pandemic (Covid-19), called as 'Go Fit'. As
we know in this difficult time it is safe to stay home, so this application is specially designed
for the ones who love to be physically fit and active. People are not able to attend the gym
physically, this service will help giving them the pleasure to feel the experience of a gym at
home, they could simply enroll and enjoy all the services. Now coming on to the interface of
an application.

* We mainly have 3 components- The Administrator, Customer and a Trainer.

* Administrator handles all the admin work. Keeping record of instruments, maintaining files
which include customer’s information and also files with information of a trainer,
maintaining attendance sheet, have access to data related to the payments, who all have paid
and the salary related information as well, sending reminders related to dues or reschedules.
As administrator keeps a track record of payments so they have an access to give printed
payment receipts to a customer. Administrator helps creating a roster of classes like Zumba,
Yoga, Dance and others. Could enter the information and create an account for trainer.

* Coming on to Customer, there are two types of consumers, consumers with basic plan and
consumers with premium plan. Basic and premium plans have their own different cost. Basic
plan includes information with very few exercises and daily routine. They are not allowed for
the classes like Zumba or Yoga and other. Consumer with a basic plan is not assigned a
trainer and could not access information about a trainer or so. Whereas consumer with
Premium subscription is eligible for trainer allotment and is allotted a trainer and could
access the trainer component in the application. In premium plan, consumers get a diet plan
and class access too. Full schedule of classes starts reflecting in their profile. Additional
feature for customers is an in-build chat box, where they could chat and clear any doubts or
could ask about any information.

* Trainer is another component, trainer could see the data of a consumer, could check the
regularity of a client in classes and could check their exercise schedules. Also, trainer gets a
query and opportunity to resolve a query as well. Additional access to a trainer is that he
could answer his clients and could talk to them through a chat box.

## Objectives of Project

* The project ‘Go-Fit’ is a java-based application which is developed using concept of advance java like java swing and the database used for back-end connectivity is my sql. whose motivation came in lockdown period when the entire GYM Industry suffered heavily due to covid-19 pandemic. This struck me with the idea of making this java application as the people who worked in GYM basically lost their livelihood. What this application does is enable gym owners and trainers to generate a revenue by providing paid services to the customer. 

* The Overall objective of this application is to help gym owner and trainer to raise some kind of revenue and also help the customer to retain their fitness at ease of their home this application removes the barrier and enable customer to virtually connect with his trainer for any kind of query on the other hand helps administrator to manage customer and trainer data in a proper and organized manner also enable him to do more work in short time stamp 


## Project Design Phases

#### Phase 1: System/Information Engineering and Modeling

* In this, the information of the project was gathered to meet the requirements. As software is always of a large system (or business), work begins by establishing requirements   for all system elements and then allocating some subset of these requirements to software. This system view is essential when software must interface with other elements such as hardware, people and other resources

#### Phase 2: Software Requirement Analysis

* This is also known as feasibility study. In this phase, the development team visits the customer and studies their system. They investigate the need for possible software automation in the given system. By the end of the feasibility study, the team furnishes a document that holds the different specific recommendations for the candidate system. 

#### Phase 3: System Analysis and Design 

* In this phase, the software development process, the software's overall structure and its nuances are defined. In terms of the client/server technology, the number of tiers needed forthe package architecture, the database design, the data structure design etc are all defined in this phase. A software development model is created. Analysis and Design are very crucial in the whole development cycle. 

#### Phase 4: Code generation

* The code is written in Java. The design must be translated into a machine-readable form. The code generation step performs this task. If the design is performed in a detailed manner, code generation can be accomplished without much complication. . Different high level programming languages like C, C++, Pascal, and Java are used for coding. With respect to the type of application, the right programming language is chosen.

#### Phase 5:Testing

* Different tests were performed to check the proper functioning of Branush Hub. Different test users were added to check the authenticity and proper functioning of the code. Several error cases were also tested and were corrected if any error was found. Once the code is generated, the software program testing begins. Different testing methodologies are available to unravel the bugs that were committed during the previous phases.

#### Phase 6: Maintenance

* Software will definitely undergo change once it is delivered to the customer. There are many reasons for the change. Change could happen because of some unexpected input values into the system. In addition, the changes in the system could directly affect the software operations. The software should be developed to accommodate changes that could happen during the post implementation period.


## CONCLUSIONS 
The project 'Go Fit' mainly help gym's which are small and medium sized. This application helps to enable the gym owners to generate revenue and further offers an online platform for their business model.
In today's world, technology is very useful in general, it helps us to increase business of gym owners, decrease the competition, be unique in the market, increase the revenue, and also this model is very customer friendly, easy to adapt and very effective.
The interface is really easy to use and a trainer directly links the customers with each other,
trainer also take care of various tie-ups
