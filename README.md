# Go-Fit

## Introduction
* The project ‘Go-Fit’ is a java-based application whose motivation came in lockdown period when the entire GYM Industry suffered heavily due to covid-19 pandemic. This struck me with the idea of making this java application as the people who worked in GYM basically lost their livelihood. What this application does is enable gym owners and trainers to generate a revenue by providing paid services to the customer. 

* Customer is provided an in-build chat service by which he can directly get in touch with the assigned trainer regarding his queries and can provide feedback to the owner of the gym. 

* Administrator is provided with rights to controls and manage the activities of customer and the trainer 

* Trainer is provided with the list of all the customers assigned to him and also provide with a in build chat service to interaction and answered queries of the customer
