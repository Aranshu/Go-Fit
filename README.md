# Go-Fit

## Introduction
* We have designed an application in the era of a pandemic (Covid-19), called as 'Go Fit'. As
we know in this difficult time it is safe to stay home, so this application is specially designed
for the ones who love to be physically fit and active. People are not able to attend the gym
physically, this service will help giving them the pleasure to feel the experience of a gym at
home, they could simply enroll and enjoy all the services. Now coming on to the interface of
an application.

* We mainly have 3 components- The Administrator, Customer and a Trainer.

* Administrator handles all the admin work. Keeping record of instruments, maintaining files
which include customerâ€™s information and also files with information of a trainer,
maintaining attendance sheet, have access to data related to the payments, who all have paid
and the salary related information as well, sending reminders related to dues or reschedules.
As administrator keeps a track record of payments so they have an access to give printed
payment receipts to a customer. Administrator helps creating a roster of classes like Zumba,
Yoga, Dance and others. Could enter the information and create an account for trainer.

* Coming on to Customer, there are two types of consumers, consumers with basic plan and
consumers with premium plan. Basic and premium plans have their own different cost. Basic
plan includes information with very few exercises and daily routine. They are not allowed for
the classes like Zumba or Yoga and other. Consumer with a basic plan is not assigned a
trainer and could not access information about a trainer or so. Whereas consumer with
Premium subscription is eligible for trainer allotment and is allotted a trainer and could
access the trainer component in the application. In premium plan, consumers get a diet plan
and class access too. Full schedule of classes starts reflecting in their profile. Additional
feature for customers is an in-build chat box, where they could chat and clear any doubts or
could ask about any information.

* Trainer is another component, trainer could see the data of a consumer, could check the
regularity of a client in classes and could check their exercise schedules. Also, trainer gets a
query and opportunity to resolve a query as well. Additional access to a trainer is that he
could answer his clients and could talk to them through a chat box.
